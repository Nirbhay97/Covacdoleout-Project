# Covacdoleout-Project
The project is for efficient distribution of vaccines
 # Inspiration
The country has been caught unprepared in handling of the second wave. Mass vaccination seems like the only hope but the distribution strategies have largely failed us. Answering the distress calls emanating from the society, our team has come with the project COVAC DOLE OUT

We do had a lot of ideas but we went ahead with CoVac Doleout because its the need of the hour and needed immediate attention.

# What it does
It integrates the government, private firms and the citizens of the country in the process of efficient distribution of vaccines.

# How we built it
The project includes app and a web portal. We used justinmind software to develop an app and VS code for writing html code for the web.

# Challenges we ran into
Many times, we had to learn new things through YouTube videos before we could implement the same. We challenged our development skills and put our creativity, efficiency to the test.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Though building such a significant project was not easy within 36 hours, but the zeal for the quest to stand out made us to complete the project on time. We were able to built an app and a web portal hosting our ideas and the process of implementation of it.

# What we learned
We learned to collaborate under pressure and leant many technical aspects. Most importantly, we enhanced our capabilities to work as a team(Team spirit).

# What's next for CoVac Doleout
We need volunteers and bring the firms together in a single bond working for the same cause, that is beneficial for everyone
